# packmule

Packmule's workflow revolves around 'Pack Hubs' (windows inside the program). They are representations of the addons present in any given file directory. Pack Hubs can be created with the File menu or with the ctrl + n shortcut. When a directory is entered into the textbox at the bottom of a Pack hub, it will be searched for valid behavior packs, resource packs, and minecraft worlds. These packs/worlds will populate a listbox in the Packhub and can be deleted with the large red button or copied to the target hub with the green button.
